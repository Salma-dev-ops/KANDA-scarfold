## ✅ TODO

- Implement governance-based split (40/30/20/10) with transparent distribution addresses
- Add IPFS pinning and media upload flow for audio/video/images with metadata
- Require multi-validator threshold (e.g., 3-of-N) before `verified = true`
- Add dispute resolution and community governance token mechanics
- Expand i18n: language detection + translations across UI
- Improve mobile-first layouts and offline-friendly assets
- Add unit tests (Solidity + frontend) and basic analytics dashboard

## 🚨 **THE CULTURAL CRISIS WE FACE TODAY**

### **Our Heritage is Disappearing Before Our Eyes**
- 📉 **Every 14 days**, another African language dies forever
- 👴 **90% of African elders** will take their stories to the grave - unrecorded, unlicensed, unrewarded
- 🏛️ **$2.6 billion** annual revenue from "African-inspired" content goes to foreign companies, not creators
- 📱 **85% of African youth** can't name 5 traditional stories from their own community

---

## 🔥 **Why This Matters RIGHT NOW**

African cultural artifacts, traditional knowledge, and intangible heritage face **extinction** due to:
- 📉 **Cultural Erasure**: Urbanization and globalization are wiping out traditions faster than we can preserve them
- 💸 **Economic Exploitation**: Our ancestors' wisdom generates billions for others while communities stay poor  
- 🏛️ **Digital Colonialism**: Western institutions monetize African elements without compensation or credit
- 👥 **Knowledge Gap**: Elders die with untold stories while youth disconnect from their roots
- ⚖️ **No Ownership**: Zero systems to prove authenticity or claim rightful compensation for our heritage

**The Clock is Ticking**: We're not just losing stories - we're losing our identity, our economic power, and our children's birthright.

🌍 Our Vision

KANDA is more than a platform — it’s a movement. We envision a future where African culture is not just preserved but also valued globally as a source of pride, wealth, and identity. By combining blockchain technology with community-driven validation, we ensure that every story, song, and tradition becomes a living digital asset — owned by its people, accessible to the world, and rewarding to its guardians. Our goal is to transform cultural heritage from something at risk of extinction into a sustainable economy that empowers Africans and inspires generations.

### **Frontend Architecture (Next.js + TypeScript)**
```typescript
packages/nextjs/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx                   // Landing page with problem statement
│   ├── create/page.tsx            // Heritage creation form
│   ├── marketplace/page.tsx       // Browse and license heritage
│   └── community/page.tsx         // Dashboard with integrated verification
├── components/
│   └── HeritageCard.tsx          // Reusable heritage display component
├── hooks/

└── styles/
    └── globals.css               // Tailwind + custom styling
```

### **Custom Hook Architecture**
Simplified single-hook approach leveraging Scaffold-ETH2:

```typescript
useKanda() {
  ├── allHeritages           // Query all minted items
  ├── myHeritages            // User's created heritage
  ├── isValidator            // Check validator status
  ├── mintHeritage()         // Create new heritage NFT
  ├── verifyHeritage()       // Elder validation
  ├── licenseHeritage()      // Purchase and distribute payment
  └── Loading states         // isMinting, isVerifying, isLicensing
}
```

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v20.18.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Install dependencies if it was skipped in CLI:

```
cd KANDA-scarfold
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`

- Edit your smart contracts in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
